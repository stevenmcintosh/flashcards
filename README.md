# 📚 Flashcards App

A simple, fun, and functional flashcards app — built as a father-daughter project powered by AI inspiration.

## 🚀 What is this?

This is a lightweight web app for creating, organizing, importing, and exporting flashcards by category. It was designed to help students revise smarter and faster — starting with a real need: GCSE science prep at home.

## 👨‍👧 Why we built it

After attending an AI seminar on rapid prototyping and viral app strategies (shoutout to Anthony Villa and Brian Gallagher!), we were inspired to put AI into practice.

My daughter was spending hours making handwritten flashcards. So we asked:
> “Can we build a digital version that’s easier, faster, and just as effective?”

One hour later: ✅ Working prototype, ✅ Real use case, ✅ Proud daughter.

## ✨ Features

- Create and edit flashcards by category
- Import/export flashcard sets
- Clean, responsive UI (mobile-friendly)
- Designed for students, by a student

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Cursor.dev (AI-assisted coding)
- No frameworks (yet!) — simple and easy to extend

## 📦 Coming Soon

- Hosted version on custom domain
- Public flashcard sharing
- SEO optimization
- Ads (because why not start that passive income journey?)
- More feedback and iteration with my co-founder (aka daughter!)

## 🤝 Contribute / Feedback

This is a personal, educational, and fun build — but we’d love feedback or feature ideas. Feel free to fork or raise an issue!

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Building with AI is fast — but building *with purpose* is faster.
- Kids have the best product instincts.
- One hour of focus can change the game.
